# PySpark for Data Engineering

## Spark Fundamentals
- [ ] What is Apache Spark?
- [ ] Spark Architecture (Driver, Executor, Cluster Manager)
- [ ] RDD vs DataFrame vs Dataset
- [ ] Lazy Evaluation
- [ ] Spark Session vs Spark Context

## PySpark Setup
- [ ] Installation & Configuration
- [ ] Creating SparkSession
- [ ] Local vs Cluster Mode
- [ ] Configuring Memory & Cores

## RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
- [ ] Creating RDDs (parallelize, textFile)
- [ ] Transformations (map, filter, flatMap, reduceByKey)
- [ ] Actions (collect, count, first, take, reduce)
- [ ] RDD Persistence (cache, persist)
- [ ] Partitioning & Repartitioning

## DataFrames & Datasets
- [ ] Creating DataFrames (from RDD, from files)
- [ ] Schema Definition (StructType, StructField)
- [ ] select, selectExpr, withColumn, withColumnRenamed
- [ ] filter, where, drop, dropDuplicates
- [ ] sort, orderBy, limit
- [ ] groupBy, agg, pivot
- [ ] join (inner, left, right, outer, cross)
- [ ] union, unionAll, unionByName

## Spark SQL
- [ ] Creating Temp Views
- [ ] Running SQL Queries
- [ ] Built-in Functions (pyspark.sql.functions)
- [ ] User Defined Functions (UDFs)
- [ ] Window Functions

## Data Types & Handling
- [ ] Data Types (String, Integer, Float, Date, Timestamp)
- [ ] Type Casting (cast function)
- [ ] Handling NULL Values (na.drop, na.fill, na.replace)
- [ ] String Manipulation
- [ ] Date & Timestamp Operations

## File Formats & I/O
- [ ] CSV (read/write, options)
- [ ] JSON (read/write, multiline)
- [ ] Parquet (read/write, partitionBy)
- [ ] Avro (read/write)
- [ ] Delta Lake (read/write)
- [ ] ORC Format
- [ ] Reading/Writing to Databases (JDBC)

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Understanding Partitions
- [ ] repartition vs coalesce
- [ ] Broadcasting (broadcast join)
- [ ] Caching & Persistence
- [ ] Spark UI & Monitoring
- [ ] Explain Plan
- [ ] Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)

## Advanced Topics
- [ ] Accumulators
- [ ] Broadcast Variables
- [ ] Custom Partitioners
- [ ] Structured Streaming
- [ ] Spark MLlib Basics

## Integration
- [ ] PySpark with Delta Lake
- [ ] PySpark with AWS S3
- [ ] PySpark with Azure Blob Storage
- [ ] PySpark with Databricks
