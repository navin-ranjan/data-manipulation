1. What is a Database?
A database is a collection of structured data that is stored and managed electronically. It organizes data in tables (rows & columns) and allows efficient access, retrieval, and manipulation.

2. Types of Databases
Relational Database (RDBMS) – Stores data in tables with relationships.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, MariaDB

NoSQL Database – Stores data in different formats like key-value, document, column-family, and graph.

Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase

3. SQL vs NoSQL
SQL (Structured Query Language): Used for querying relational databases.

NoSQL: Used for handling unstructured and large-scale data.

4. Key Database Concepts
Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.

Foreign Key: Establishes relationships between tables.

Indexing: Improves data retrieval speed.

Normalization: Reduces redundancy in databases.

5. Database Operations
CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete

Transactions: Ensures data integrity (ACID properties – Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

1. What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to perform operations like querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data.

2. Types of SQL Commands
DDL (Data Definition Language) – Defines database structure

CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE

DML (Data Manipulation Language) – Modifies data

INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT

DCL (Data Control Language) – Controls access

GRANT, REVOKE

TCL (Transaction Control Language) – Manages transactions

COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

3. Key SQL Concepts
Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each record.

Foreign Key: Creates a link between two tables.

Indexing: Speeds up data retrieval.

Joins: Combines data from multiple tables (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN).
