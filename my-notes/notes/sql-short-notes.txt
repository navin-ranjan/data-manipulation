---------- JOIN -------------------

INNER JOIN: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table; unmatched rows in the right table are NULL.
RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table; unmatched rows in the left table are NULL.
FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows when there is a match in either table; unmatched rows in both tables are NULL.
CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (all possible combinations of rows).
SELF JOIN: Joins a table with itself using aliases to differentiate.

--------------- Aggregation ---------------------------

COUNT(): Counts the number of rows (e.g., COUNT(*) for all rows or COUNT(column) for non-NULL values).
SUM(): Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
AVG(): Calculates the average of a numeric column.
MIN(): Finds the smallest value in a column.
MAX(): Finds the largest value in a column.
GROUP BY: Groups rows with the same values into summary rows for aggregation.
HAVING: Filters aggregated results (used with GROUP BY).
