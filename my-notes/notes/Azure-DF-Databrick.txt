------------ cluster type in databricks ------------------
1. All-Purpose Clusters (Interactive Clusters) : Running Notebooks, Interactive Development
2. Job Clusters: Automated ETL Jobs, Scheduled Workloads
3. High Concurrency Clusters: BI Queries, Multi-User SQL Dashboards

------------- ADF, Linked service, Dataset, Pipeline -------------
Linked Services
âœ… Definition: Acts like a connection string to external data sources (SQL, Blob Storage, API, etc.).
âœ… Use Case: Think of it as a bridge that allows ADF to connect to and retrieve data from sources.
Datasets
âœ… Definition: Represents a structured format of data within ADF, pointing to a specific table, folder, or file.
âœ… Use Case: Defines what data to pull or process from a source.
ðŸ”¹ Example: A dataset can be a table in SQL Server or a CSV file in Blob Storage.
Pipelines
âœ… Definition: A workflow that automates data movement and transformation in ADF.
âœ… Use Case: Used to schedule, monitor, and automate ETL processes.
ðŸ”¹ Example: A pipeline that copies data from Azure Blob Storage to Azure SQL Database, cleans it, and loads it into a data warehouse.

How They Work Together:
Linked Service â†’ Connects ADF to a data source (e.g., Azure SQL).
Dataset â†’ Defines the structure of the data (e.g., a specific table in SQL).
Pipeline â†’ Orchestrates the data flow, scheduling and transforming data between sources.
